        <p>The oldest classical British and <b>Latin writings had little</b> or no space between
             words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time,
              text direction (left to right) <i>became standardized. Word</i> dividers and terminal 
              punctuation became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the
               original paragraphos, <u>similar to an underscore at</u> the beginning of the new group.[1]
                The Greek parágraphos evolved into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in 
                the Middle Ages can be seen inserted inline between sentences.</p>

        <pre>A second common modern English style is to use no indenting,                 but add vertical white space to create "block paragraphs." On a typewriter, 
            a double carriage return produces a blank line for this purpose; professional typesetters 
            (or word processing software) may put in an arbitrary vertical space by adjusting leading. This 
            style is very common in electronic formats, such as on the World Wide Web and email. Wikipedia itself employs this
             format.</pre>
